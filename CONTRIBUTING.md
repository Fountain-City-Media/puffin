# Contributing

There are many ways you can contribute to Puffin project, I hope that everyone will find something for themselves.

If you would like to discuss any subject related to Puffin please visit our [Forum](http://forum.puffin.rocks/).

If you'd like to contact us directly, please send an email to [puffin@puffin.rocks](mailto:puffin@puffin.rocks).

## Issues

If you find an bug in Puffin, or would like to propose an enhancement, 
please report it via [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/puffinrocks/puffin/issues).

## Adding new applications to the catalog

First check how other applications are configured in [apps/](https://github.com/puffinrocks/apps) repository. 
All you need is a standard docker-compose.yml and README.md files - Puffin does not require any custom 
application manifest.

To add your application contact us to create a repository for it under 
[puffinrocks](https://github.com/puffinrocks) organisation or
fork [apps](https://github.com/puffinrocks/apps) repository,
add your own repository to it as a submodule and submit a Pull Request with your changes.

If you run into any trouble, or would like to add an application to the wishlist,
please visit the [Forum Apps Section](http://forum.puffin.rocks/t/apps).

There is no strict policy which applications will be accepted to the Puffin catalog yet,
but the main conditions are free / open source license and relatively low memory footprint.

## Development

For core project organisation we use [Trello](https://trello.com/b/ov1cHTtu). 
If you'd like to contribute code, feel free to open a [Github Issue](https://github.com/puffinrocks/puffin/issues) 
and send us a pull request.

## Running your own Puffin

You can run your own Puffin for yourself and your friends. 

First you need to do is to is to install Docker on your server - the easiest way to
achieve that is via [Docker Machine](README.md#docker-machine). 
Next you need to run Puffin [Production Deployment](README.md#production-deployment). 

If you run into any trouble, please visit the [Forum Hosting Section](http://forum.puffin.rocks/t/hosting).

Keep in mind the software is in early alpha development stage, so for the moment it should be used for 
experimentation only.
