## Running your own Puffin

You can run your own Puffin for yourself and your friends. 
First you need to do is to is to install Docker on your server. 
The easiest way is via Docker Machine [in the cloud](https://docs.docker.com/machine/get-started-cloud/) 
or on [your own server](http://loomchild.net/2015/09/20/your-own-docker-machine/).

Next you need to run Puffin. To do that follow the instructions in README file for 
[Private Deployment](README.md#private-deployment). Keep in mind the software is in early alpha 
development stage, so for the moment it should be used for experimentation only.
