# Contributing

There are many ways you can contribute to Puffin project. 
I hope that everyone will find something for themselves.

## Adding new applications

To do that see how other applications are configured in [apps/](apps/) directory. 
For this repository and propose a Pull Request.
There are no clear rules which applications will be accepted yet,
but the main conditions are Free / Open Source License and relatively low memory footprint 
(this will be improved by using special optimized database dependency container images).

## Issues

If you find an issue in Puffin, please report it via [GitHub](/issues).

## Development

For project Organisation we use [Trello](). 

## Running your own Puffin

You can run your own clone of puffin for yourself or your friends. 
All you need to do is to is to install Docker on your server (the easiest way to do it is via [docker-machine](), 
see my article) and run it [link to README].
For security reasons, make sure to change the SECRET_KEY.

## Server
