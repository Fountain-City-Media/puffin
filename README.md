# Puffin
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/loomchild/puffin.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/loomchild/puffin)

## Introduction

The goal of the project is to allow average, tech-oriented users to run 
their own web applications, without worrying about maintaining a server. 
The ultimate aim is to achieve greater decentralization of federated 
services, such as social networks, file sharing, blog or email.

While many other tools are looking at containers as a way to run massive 
applications, automatically scaling to millions of users, 
Puffin allows running lightweight applications serving just a single user or 
a handful of users.

In the inital form Puffin is essentially a web application catalog for Docker, 
with easy to use interface Ã  la app store. 
Security will be managed through automatic software updates. 
Beginners will be able to run containers for free on hardware provided by volunteers, 
while more demanding users will be able to connect their own machine to run 
their or their friends' applications.

## Demo

Live demo is available at [puffin.rocks](http://puffin.rocks)

## Deployment

### Demo deployment

The easiest way to deploy Puffin and start playing with it is to run it using 
Docker Compose. To deploy Puffin and its dependencies run:

	docker-compose up -d

Go to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) to acces Puffin. 
Log In as user "puffin", password "puffin". Alternatively you can register 
your own user and confirm the email address via 
[http://localhost:8025](http://localhost:8025). 

Update docker images:

	docker-compose pull

### Single-user deployment

To deploy Puffin for a single user use docker-compose-single.yml file. 
In an initial form it will deploy on locahost:

    docker-compose -f docker-compose-single.yml up -d
 
There is no email server configured and you can't register new users. 
Log in as user "puffin", password "puffin".

If you want to run it on a public server copy the configuration file and 
set SERVER_NAME, VIRTUAL_HOST and SECRET_KEY environment variables and 
make sure to change the default password.

### Multi-user deployment

To deploy Puffin for many users and allow registering new ones use 
docker-compose-multi.yml file. In an initial form it will deploy on locahost:

    docker-compose -f docker-compose-multi.yml up -d
 
If you want to run it on a public server copy the configuration file and 
set SERVER_NAME, VIRTUAL_HOST, SECRET_KEY and MAIL\_\* environment variables 
and make sure to change the default password.

### Development deployment directly on host system

During development it's more convenient to run Puffin in virtualenv. 
You can still run all dependencies via Docker, but execute Puffin 
directly on the host system.

#### Dependencies:

Make sure that you have Python 3 installed on your system. For example on Debian run:

    apt-get install python3

#### Virtual environment

First of all you need to install it:

    apt-get install python3-venv

then create it:

    pyvenv env

and activate it:
    
    . env/bin/activate

Next you can install runtime and development dependencies:
    
    pip install -r requirements-dev.txt

You might have some problems in the last step, most likely due to missing libraries on your system. 
Read the message carefully and install the development versions of offending library 
(usually lib&lt;name&gt;-dev on Debian).

#### Run dependencies

Run dependencies, such as database and mail server, and configure them:

    docker-compose -f docker-compose-deps.yml up -d

#### Run Puffin

Finally run Puffin:

    ./puffin.py server

If you want to automatically reload the server on any code change, 
I recommend using [reload](https://github.com/loomchild/reload):

    reload ./puffin.py server

### Set-up DNS

To access applications from localhost you need to set-up DNS. 
On public server you need to configure wildacard DNS record to point to your domain.
On localhost there are two alternative solutions to this problem: 
set up a local DNS server or update /etc/hosts file.

#### Local DNS server using dnsmasq

First install dnsmasq and use the following configuration file 
(on Debian create a new file in /etc/dnsmasq.d/): 
    
    address=/localhost/127.0.0.1

Next configure your nameservers in resolv.conf by adding the following line at the beginning 
(caution - this file is often overwritten by other programs such as NetworkManager - 
refer to their documentation on how to preserve this setting):

    nameserver 127.0.0.1

#### Update /etc/hosts

Update your /etc/hosts file, by adding the following lines:

    127.0.1.1 ghost.puffin.localhost
    127.0.1.1 rocket.chat.puffin.localhost
    127.0.1.1 owncloud.puffin.localhost
    127.0.1.1 redmine.puffin.localhost
    127.0.1.1 wordpress.puffin.localhost
    127.0.1.1 gogs.puffin.localhost

Each line corresponds to an application and user, add more if you want to try more applications. 

### Docker Machine

If you can't use docker directly on your system or would like to deploy 
Puffin on a remote server, Docker Machine comes in handy.

For example to create and activate a local virtual machine, run:

	docker-machine create -d virtualbox dev
	eval "$(docker-machine env dev)"

After that all subsequent Docker commands will be executed in a virtual machine. 
Keep in mind that you'll need to use IP address or hostname of the machine 
to access Puffin, instead of locahost.

## Configuration

Puffin is configured via environment variables. 

Either set them directly before starting it:

    export SECRET_KEY=mysupersecretkey

or cofigure them in Docker Compose file.
