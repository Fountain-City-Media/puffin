# Puffin

## Intro

The goal of the project is to allow average, tech-oriented users to run their own server applications, without worrying about maintaining a server. The ultimate aim is to achieve greater decentralization of federated services, such as social networking, file sharing, blog or email, on the net.

While many other tools are looking at containers as a way to run massive applications, automatically scaling to millions of users, Puffin allows running lightweight applications serving just a single user or a handful of users.

First version is essentially a specialized package manager for Docker, with easy to use interface Ã  la app store. Security will be managed through automatic software updates. Beginners will be able to run containers for free on hardware provided by volunteers, while more demanding users will be able to connect their own machine to run their or their friends' applications.
